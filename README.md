## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a new coder passionate about **data science**.

I leverage **Python** for data manipulation with **Pandas**, build robust models with **scikit-learn (sklearn)**, and apply various **machine learning** techniques to extract insights. I also use **R** for statistical analysis and create compelling **data visualizations** to tell impactful stories. My interests extend to **psychometric testing** and understanding data in the context of human behavior.
